# Why we use github?

### Git hub is public repository to store projects. With the help of git hub most of the problem regarding project get solved just like
* Merging code while multiple users are working on same file. 
* Managing number of versions of code (Date wise or Functionality wise)
* Using git pull request one manager will be there to view code quality.
* By using comments we can track change in code and the user who change it.
* We can revert back too certain stage where code was working fine.
* Branching strategy to manage new versions and much more.

### We got provided two type of repositories over here**
- **a. Public repository**: Anyone can see a public repository
- **b. Private Repository**: By default, only you can see a private repository 

### Each time you make changes to your local repository, youâ€™ll need to sync your changes.
Here are some great reasons to push projects to GitHub:
#### a. Version Control 
Everything on GitHub is stored in Git, the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.
#### b. Keep your code in one place 
Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some old projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.
#### c. Collaboration
Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you. Send them a link to help you debug a problem.
