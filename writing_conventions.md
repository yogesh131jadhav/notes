#Welcome to Document Manager.

### Points to take care while writing document.

Here we are managing document by following conventions

**For Title ie Heading1** we use Single Hash

**For Point ie Heading2** we use Triple Hash

**For Sub Point ie Heading3** we use four Hash

**For Child Point ie Heading4** we use Double star

We are not using much more decoration here. Our focus is document which we creating.
