# Naming Conventions:

If we consider books for our personal understanding.
### Repository
— Repository is somewhere new subject.
### Branch
— Branch will be consider as a publication.

Each time you make changes to your local repository, you’ll need to sync your changes.
Here are some great reasons to push projects to GitHub:
### a. Version Control 
	— Everything on GitHub is stored in Git, the best version control system around. Version control allows you to experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.
### b. Keep your code in one place 
	— Whether you work on multiple computers or just want to get some old projects off your computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store your projects online.
### c. Collaboration
	— Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you. Send them a link to help you debug a problem.
