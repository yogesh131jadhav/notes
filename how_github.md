# How we use github?

As mentioned above Git hub is public repository to store projects.
**Here we have two repositories as follows**
* Local repository on your computer.
* Remote repository on git hub.

**Git hub contains all records of data with comments. If we want to get data from repository then we have three ways to do this.**

**a. Pull changes **

Here we already working on some backup and we pull changes made by someone.


** b. Clone Repository **

Here we pull new copy of repository on computer.


** c. Create own repository **

Here in this we create our own repository on github.com and create local repository for it.
